# Module 1: Foundations of Critical Thinking

## Title: What Is an Argument? Validity, Soundness, and Structure

### Lecture Content

Critical thinking begins with understanding arguments: not fights, but structured claims supported by reasons. An argument consists of premises (reasons) and a conclusion (the claim supported by those reasons). Good thinkers know how to identify, formalize, and evaluate arguments quickly.

#### 1. What Counts as an Argument
An argument exists when a writer/speaker offers one or more statements as support for another statement.

**Example:**
- P1: Exercise improves cardiovascular health.
- P2: Activities that improve cardiovascular health reduce mortality risk.
- C: Therefore, exercise reduces mortality risk.

#### 2. Premises, Conclusions, and Indicators
- **Premise indicators:** because, since, given that, for the reason that…
- **Conclusion indicators:** therefore, thus, so, hence, it follows that…

#### 3. Validity vs Soundness
- **Validity:** If premises were true, conclusion must be true. Structure only.
- **Soundness:** Valid + premises actually true.

**Example of valid but unsound:**
- P1: All animals can fly.
- P2: Cats are animals.
- C: Therefore, cats can fly.
(Valid form, false premises → not sound.)

#### 4. Argument vs Explanation
- **Argument:** tries to prove something
- **Explanation:** clarifies something already accepted

**Examples:**
- Argument: "You should wear a helmet because it reduces injury risk."
- Explanation: "You fell because the road was slippery."

#### 5. Hidden Assumptions
Most arguments contain implicit premises.

**Example:**
"You shouldn't trust that study because it's not peer-reviewed."
Hidden assumption: Peer review is a reliable indicator of study quality.

#### 6. Practice Skill: Formalization
Reduce informal text into clean premise–conclusion form to spot bad structure.

**Worked Example:**
Text: "Social media is addictive, so teenagers shouldn't use it excessively."
- Premise 1: Social media is addictive.
- Hidden premise: Addictive things should not be used excessively.
- Conclusion: Teenagers shouldn't use social media excessively.

### Exercises (Complete all 5)
1. Identify conclusion in: "Since the engine won't start, and the battery is old, the battery is dead."
2. Rewrite in P1, P2, C form: "You should save money because inflation is rising."
3. Spot hidden premise: "He must be trustworthy; he has a PhD."
4. Is this valid or invalid? "All dogs bark. Rex barks. Therefore Rex is a dog."
5. Convert explanation → argument: "He quit his job because he was exhausted."
