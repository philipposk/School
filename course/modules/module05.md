# Module 5: Cognitive Biases & Debiasing

## Title: Overcoming Mental Shortcuts: Recognizing and Correcting Biases

### Lecture Content

Humans rely on mental shortcuts (heuristics) that often lead to systematic errors in thinking. Understanding and correcting these biases is essential for clear thinking.

#### 1. Key Cognitive Biases

**Confirmation Bias:**
- Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs
- Ignoring disconfirming evidence

**Anchoring:**
- Relying too heavily on first piece of information
- Example: Initial price affecting subsequent valuations

**Availability Heuristic:**
- Judging probability based on ease of recall
- Vivid examples feel more probable

**Overconfidence:**
- Overestimating knowledge or abilities
- Example: 90% confidence in answers that are 70% correct

**Motivated Reasoning:**
- Reasoning driven by desired conclusions
- Emotional investment in outcomes

**Hindsight Bias:**
- "I knew it all along" effect
- Overestimating predictability of past events

#### 2. Debiasing Techniques

**Pre-mortem Analysis:**
- Imagine project failed, identify reasons why
- Prevents planning fallacy

**Seeking Disconfirming Evidence:**
- Actively look for information that challenges beliefs
- Reduces confirmation bias

**Slow Thinking:**
- Deliberate, analytical processing
- Counteracts intuitive errors

**Independent Checks:**
- External validation of reasoning
- Reduces individual bias

**Probabilistic Framing:**
- Think in percentages and ranges
- Avoids binary thinking

#### 3. Implementation Strategies

**Daily Practice:**
- Bias awareness journal
- Regular self-reflection
- Seeking diverse perspectives

**Worked Example:**
Anchoring in salary negotiations: First number mentioned anchors subsequent discussion, affecting final outcome.

### Exercises
1. Identify bias in a social media post or news article
2. Give example of motivated reasoning in politics
3. Describe debiasing technique you can apply daily
4. Create pre-mortem for a small personal project
5. Why does availability bias feel "true" even when misleading?
