# Module 3: Induction, Evidence & Strength

## Title: Inductive Reasoning: From Specific to General

### Lecture Content

Induction moves from specific observations to general conclusions. It's never certain but can be strong or weak depending on evidence quality.

#### 1. Inductive Generalization
Sample → population inference.
**Strength depends on:**
- Sample size
- Representativeness
- Randomness

**Example:**
"Every raven I've seen is black; therefore ravens are black."
Strong if sample is large/random; weak otherwise.

#### 2. Analogical Reasoning
Similarity in key features → likely similarity in other features.
**Quality depends on:**
- Number of similarities
- Relevance of similarities
- Number of dissimilarities

#### 3. Evidence Quality
**Types of evidence:**
- Direct vs indirect
- Correlation vs causation
- Anecdotes vs data
- Primary vs secondary sources

#### 4. Indicators of Strength
- Variety of evidence sources
- Mechanism explaining why
- Independent verification
- Replicability
- Expert consensus

#### 5. Common Pitfalls
- Hasty generalization
- Biased sampling
- Confirmation bias
- Overlooking counter-evidence

**Worked Example:**
"My three friends who exercise daily are healthy, so daily exercise makes people healthy."
Weak: small sample, potential selection bias.

### Exercises
1. Find an example of weak induction in online content
2. Create an analogical argument about technology adoption
3. Identify correlation mistaken for causation in media
4. Does a single counterexample defeat induction? Why?
5. What increases sample representativeness?

### Assignment
Choose one scientific claim. Evaluate evidence strength in 400–600 words, considering:
- Sample size and quality
- Research methodology
- Potential biases
- Replicability
- Expert consensus
