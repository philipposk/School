      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Why is it important to test AI-generated code?",
      "sampleAnswer": "AI can make mistakes, might miss edge cases, may have integration issues, and testing provides confidence that code works correctly before deployment."

      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What's the difference between unit, integration, and E2E tests?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Unit tests: individual components/functions, fast and isolated. Integration tests: how components work together, medium speed. E2E tests: complete user workflows, slower, full system."

      "id": 9,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "How do you debug a failing test?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Read the error message, understand what failed, check test expectations, verify the code behavior, fix the code or test as needed, then re-run tests."

      "question": "Explain the benefits of test-driven development with AI.",
      "sampleAnswer": "TDD with AI provides: clear requirements upfront, better test coverage, more focused code generation, and ensures code meets test specifications from the start."
