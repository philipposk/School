      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Backend proxy keeps API keys secret by handling API calls server-side instead of exposing keys in client code."

      "id": 7,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Why use environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Environment variables keep secrets secure, allow different configs for dev/prod, prevent accidental exposure in code, and make it easy to change without code modifications."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What's the difference between frontend and backend deployment?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Frontend deployment hosts static files and client-side code (Vercel, Netlify). Backend deployment hosts server code and APIs (Railway, Render). They often use different platforms and have different requirements."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Why use a backend proxy for external API calls?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Backend proxy keeps API keys secret (not exposed in client), provides better security, enables rate limiting, centralizes error handling, and allows request transformation."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What should you check after deploying to production?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Check: functionality (all features work), performance (load times acceptable), security (HTTPS, no exposed secrets), monitoring (error tracking, analytics), and verify environment variables are set correctly."
