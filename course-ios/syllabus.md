2. Understand and implement state management patterns (@State, @Binding, @ObservableObject)
3. Create beautiful, responsive layouts using stacks, grids, and custom views
4. Integrate APIs and handle asynchronous data
5. Implement user input, forms, and data validation
6. Add animations, gestures, and custom interactions
7. Debug and test iOS applications
8. Deploy apps to the App Store following Apple's guidelines
