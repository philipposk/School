# Module 2: Understanding Debt & Credit

## Title: Credit Scores, Debt Management, and Interest Rates

### Lecture Content

Debt and credit are powerful financial tools when understood and managed properly. This module covers credit scores, types of debt, payoff strategies, and interest calculations.

#### 1. Understanding Credit Scores

A credit score is a number (typically 300-850) that represents your creditworthiness.

**Factors affecting credit score:**
- Payment history (35%)
- Credit utilization (30%)
- Length of credit history (15%)
- Credit mix (10%)
- New credit inquiries (10%)

**Credit score ranges:**
- Excellent: 750-850
- Good: 700-749
- Fair: 650-699
- Poor: 600-649
- Very Poor: Below 600

#### 2. Types of Debt

**Good Debt:**
- Mortgage (appreciating asset)
- Student loans (investment in education)
- Business loans (income generation)

**Bad Debt:**
- Credit card debt (high interest)
- Payday loans (extremely high interest)
- Car loans (depreciating asset)

**Neutral Debt:**
- Personal loans (depends on purpose and rate)

#### 3. Debt Payoff Strategies

**Debt Snowball Method:**
1. List debts smallest to largest
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put extra money toward smallest debt
4. When paid off, roll payment to next smallest
5. Repeat until debt-free

**Debt Avalanche Method:**
1. List debts by interest rate (highest first)
2. Pay minimums on all
3. Put extra money toward highest rate
4. When paid off, roll payment to next highest
5. Repeat until debt-free

**Which to choose:**
- Snowball: Better for motivation and quick wins
- Avalanche: Saves more money in interest

#### 4. Interest Rate Calculations

**Simple Interest:**
Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

**Compound Interest:**
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal
- r = Annual interest rate
- n = Compounding frequency
- t = Time in years

**APR vs APY:**
- APR: Annual Percentage Rate (doesn't include compounding)
- APY: Annual Percentage Yield (includes compounding)

#### 5. Credit Reports

**Three major bureaus:**
- Experian
- Equifax
- TransUnion

**What's included:**
- Personal information
- Credit accounts
- Payment history
- Inquiries
- Public records

**How to read:**
- Check for errors
- Review payment history
- Verify account balances
- Look for fraud indicators

#### 6. Improving Your Credit Score

**Quick wins:**
- Pay bills on time (most important)
- Reduce credit utilization below 30%
- Don't close old accounts
- Limit new credit applications

**Long-term strategies:**
- Maintain diverse credit mix
- Keep accounts open and active
- Monitor credit regularly
- Dispute errors immediately
