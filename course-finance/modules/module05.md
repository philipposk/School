# Module 5: Stocks & Bonds Fundamentals

## Title: Market Mechanics, ETFs, and Diversification

### Lecture Content

Understanding how stocks and bonds work is essential for building a solid investment portfolio. This module covers market mechanics, ETFs, mutual funds, and diversification principles.

#### 1. How Stock Markets Work

**What is a Stock?**
- Ownership share in a company
- Entitles holder to portion of profits (dividends)
- Value fluctuates based on supply/demand
- Can be sold on stock exchanges

**Stock Exchanges:**
- NYSE (New York Stock Exchange)
- NASDAQ
- European exchanges (LSE, Euronext)
- Provide liquidity and price discovery

**How Prices Move:**
- Company performance
- Economic conditions
- Investor sentiment
- Supply and demand
- News and events

**Market Participants:**
- Individual investors
- Institutional investors (pension funds, mutual funds)
- Market makers
- High-frequency traders

#### 2. Types of Stocks

**By Company Size:**
- Large-cap: €10B+ market value (stable, established)
- Mid-cap: €2B-€10B (growth potential)
- Small-cap: Under €2B (higher risk, higher potential)

**By Style:**
- Growth stocks: Fast-growing companies, reinvest profits
- Value stocks: Undervalued, may pay dividends
- Dividend stocks: Regular dividend payments

**By Sector:**
- Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Consumer, Energy, etc.
- Diversification across sectors reduces risk

#### 3. Bonds and Fixed Income

**What is a Bond?**
- Loan to company or government
- Fixed interest payments (coupon)
- Return of principal at maturity
- Generally lower risk than stocks

**Bond Types:**
- Government bonds (treasuries) - safest
- Corporate bonds - higher yield, more risk
- Municipal bonds - tax advantages
- International bonds - currency risk

**Bond Characteristics:**
- Face value (principal)
- Coupon rate (interest rate)
- Maturity date (when principal repaid)
- Credit rating (default risk)

**Bond Prices and Interest Rates:**
- Inverse relationship
- Rates up = bond prices down
- Rates down = bond prices up
- Longer maturity = more price sensitivity

#### 4. ETFs and Mutual Funds

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs):**
- Basket of securities traded like stocks
- Low expense ratios
- Intraday trading
- Tax-efficient
- Diversification in one purchase

**Mutual Funds:**
- Managed portfolio of securities
- End-of-day pricing
- Active or passive management
- May have higher fees
- Minimum investment often required

**Index Funds:**
- Track market index (S&P 500, etc.)
- Low fees
- Broad diversification
- Passive management
- Recommended for most investors

**Benefits of Funds:**
- Instant diversification
- Professional management (for active funds)
- Lower transaction costs
- Access to many securities

#### 5. Diversification Principles

**What is Diversification?**
- Spreading investments across assets
- Reduces risk without sacrificing returns
- "Don't put all eggs in one basket"

**Why It Works:**
- Different assets perform differently
- Losses in one offset by gains in another
- Reduces portfolio volatility
- Improves risk-adjusted returns

**How to Diversify:**
- Across asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate)
- Across sectors (tech, healthcare, finance)
- Across geographies (domestic, international)
- Across company sizes (large, mid, small cap)

**Diversification Limits:**
- Diminishing returns after 20-30 stocks
- Over-diversification reduces returns
- Focus on meaningful diversification

#### 6. Building a Portfolio

**Asset Allocation:**
- Stocks vs bonds ratio
- Based on age, risk tolerance, goals
- Rule of thumb: 110 - age = % in stocks
- Example: Age 30 = 80% stocks, 20% bonds

**Portfolio Examples:**

**Conservative (30% stocks, 70% bonds):**
- Retirees, low risk tolerance
- Focus on preservation

**Moderate (60% stocks, 40% bonds):**
- Mid-career, balanced approach
- Growth with stability

**Aggressive (80-90% stocks, 10-20% bonds):**
- Young investors, long time horizon
- Maximum growth potential

**Rebalancing:**
- Adjust allocation periodically
- Sell winners, buy losers (maintain target)
- Annually or when allocation drifts 5%+
- Maintains risk level
