# Module 1: Foundations of Personal Finance

## Title: Budgeting, Emergency Funds, and Financial Goals

### Lecture Content

Personal finance starts with understanding where your money goes and where you want it to go. This module covers the fundamentals: budgeting, emergency funds, and setting financial goals.

#### 1. The Importance of Budgeting
A budget is a plan for your money. It's not about restriction—it's about making intentional choices.

**Benefits:**
- Know where your money goes
- Identify spending patterns
- Achieve financial goals faster
- Reduce financial stress

#### 2. Budgeting Methods

**50/30/20 Rule:**
- 50% needs (housing, food, utilities)
- 30% wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% savings and debt repayment

**Zero-Based Budgeting:**
Every euro has a purpose. Income - Expenses = €0

**Envelope Method:**
Allocate cash to categories. When envelope is empty, spending stops.

#### 3. Creating Your Budget

**Step 1: Track Income**
- Salary
- Side income
- Investment income
- Other sources

**Step 2: List Expenses**
- Fixed expenses (rent, insurance)
- Variable expenses (groceries, utilities)
- Discretionary expenses (entertainment)

**Step 3: Categorize**
- Needs vs wants
- Essential vs optional

**Step 4: Allocate**
- Assign amounts to each category
- Ensure income covers expenses
- Prioritize savings

#### 4. Emergency Fund Basics

An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected expenses.

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents debt accumulation
- Reduces financial stress
- Provides security
- Allows better decision-making

**How much to save:**
- Starter: €1,000 (beginner emergency fund)
- Full: 3-6 months of expenses
- Extended: 6-12 months (for variable income)

**Where to keep it:**
- High-yield savings account
- Easily accessible
- Separate from checking account

#### 5. Setting Financial Goals

**SMART Goals:**
- Specific: "Save €5,000"
- Measurable: Track progress
- Achievable: Realistic for your situation
- Relevant: Aligned with your values
- Time-bound: "By December 2024"

**Goal Categories:**
- Short-term (0-1 year): Emergency fund, vacation
- Mid-term (1-5 years): Down payment, car
- Long-term (5+ years): Retirement, education

#### 6. Cash Flow Management

**Positive cash flow:** Income > Expenses
**Negative cash flow:** Expenses > Income

**Improving cash flow:**
- Increase income
- Reduce expenses
- Optimize timing of payments
