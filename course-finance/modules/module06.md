# Module 6: Retirement Planning

## Title: 401(k), IRAs, Compound Interest, and Retirement Calculators

### Lecture Content

Retirement planning is about ensuring financial security in your later years. This module covers retirement accounts, compound interest, and how to calculate what you'll need.

#### 1. Why Retirement Planning Matters

**The Retirement Challenge:**
- People live longer (20-30 years in retirement)
- Social security may be insufficient
- Healthcare costs rising
- Inflation erodes purchasing power
- Need to replace 70-80% of pre-retirement income

**Start Early Advantage:**
- Time is your greatest asset
- Compound interest works best over decades
- Smaller monthly contributions needed
- Less financial stress later

**Example:**
- Age 25: Invest €200/month at 7% = €525,000 at 65
- Age 35: Invest €400/month at 7% = €488,000 at 65
- Age 45: Invest €800/month at 7% = €365,000 at 65

#### 2. Retirement Account Types

**401(k) / Employer Plans:**
- Pre-tax contributions (reduce taxable income)
- Employer match (free money!)
- Higher contribution limits (€22,500+)
- Tax-deferred growth
- Withdrawals taxed as income
- Early withdrawal penalty before 59.5

**Traditional IRA:**
- Pre-tax contributions (if eligible)
- Tax-deferred growth
- Lower contribution limits (€6,500)
- Required minimum distributions at 72
- Early withdrawal penalty

**Roth IRA:**
- After-tax contributions
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals
- No required distributions
- Can withdraw contributions anytime
- Income limits apply

**Which to Choose:**
- 401(k) with match: Always contribute to get match
- Roth IRA: If you expect higher tax bracket in retirement
- Traditional IRA: If you want tax deduction now

#### 3. Employer Matching

**What is Matching?**
- Employer contributes based on your contribution
- Common: 50% match up to 6% of salary
- Example: €50,000 salary, 6% = €3,000, match = €1,500

**Why It Matters:**
- 100% return on your money immediately
- Free money you can't get elsewhere
- Always contribute enough to get full match

**Vesting:**
- Immediate: You own match right away
- Graduated: Ownership increases over time
- Cliff: Full ownership after X years

#### 4. Compound Interest

**How It Works:**
- Earn interest on principal
- Earn interest on interest
- Exponential growth over time
- The longer, the better

**Formula:**
A = P(1 + r)^t
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal
- r = Annual rate
- t = Time in years

**Example:**
- €10,000 at 7% for 30 years = €76,123
- €10,000 at 7% for 40 years = €149,744
- Extra 10 years = nearly double!

**Rule of 72:**
- Divide 72 by interest rate = years to double
- 7% return = doubles in ~10 years
- 10% return = doubles in ~7 years

#### 5. How Much Do You Need?

**Retirement Income Target:**
- 70-80% of pre-retirement income
- Accounts for reduced expenses (no commute, etc.)
- Adjust for lifestyle goals

**The 4% Rule:**
- Withdraw 4% of portfolio annually
- Portfolio should last 30 years
- €1,000,000 portfolio = €40,000/year
- Adjust for inflation annually

**Calculation Example:**
- Need €50,000/year in retirement
- Using 4% rule: €50,000 ÷ 0.04 = €1,250,000 needed
- This is your retirement target

**Factors Affecting Need:**
- Expected retirement age
- Life expectancy
- Healthcare costs
- Social security benefits
- Other income sources
- Desired lifestyle

#### 6. Retirement Calculators

**What They Do:**
- Estimate retirement savings needed
- Show impact of contribution changes
- Project future account values
- Compare scenarios

**Key Inputs:**
- Current age and retirement age
- Current savings

**Using Calculators:**
- Start with conservative estimates
- Run multiple scenarios
- Adjust variables to see impact
- Update annually

**Common Tools:**
- Online retirement calculators
- Spreadsheet templates
- Financial advisor tools

#### 7. Retirement Planning Steps

**Step 1: Calculate Your Number**
- Determine retirement income need
- Apply 4% rule or use calculator
- Set target savings amount

**Step 2: Assess Current Situation**
- Current retirement savings
- Current contribution rate
- Time until retirement

**Step 3: Create Action Plan**
- Increase contributions if needed
- Maximize employer match
- Open IRA if eligible
- Automate contributions

**Step 4: Invest Appropriately**
- Asset allocation based on age
- Low-cost index funds
- Diversify across accounts
- Rebalance periodically

**Step 5: Monitor and Adjust**
- Review annually
- Increase contributions with raises
- Adjust for life changes
- Stay on track

### Exercises (Complete all 5)
1. Calculate: If you need €40,000/year in retirement, how much total savings do you need (4% rule)?
2. Calculate: €5,000 invested at 7% for 35 years (compound interest).
3. If your employer matches 50% up to 6% and you earn €60,000, how much free money can you get?
4. Use Rule of 72: How long to double money at 8% return?
5. Calculate monthly contribution needed: €500,000 goal, 30 years, 7% return, starting with €10,000.
