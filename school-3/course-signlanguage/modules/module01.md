# Module 1: ASL Basics & Fingerspelling

## Title: Your First Steps in American Sign Language

### Lecture Content

Welcome to American Sign Language! ASL is a complete, natural language with its own grammar and syntax, used by the Deaf community in the United States and parts of Canada. Unlike spoken languages, ASL is visual-spatial, using handshapes, movements, facial expressions, and body language to convey meaning.

#### 1. Understanding ASL as a Language
ASL is NOT English on the hands. It has:
- Its own grammar structure (different from English)
- Visual-spatial grammar
- Facial expressions as grammatical markers
- Cultural context and community

**Key Concept:** ASL uses space, movement, and facial expressions grammatically, not just for emphasis.

#### 2. The ASL Alphabet (A-Z)
Each letter has a specific handshape. Practice forming each letter clearly.

**Visual Guide - ASL Alphabet Handshapes:**

```

#### 4. Sign Space
ASL uses space in front of your body:

```
        Sign Space Diagram
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │   Too High      │  ← Avoid
        ├─────────────────┤
        │                 │
        │  Neutral Space  │  ← Ideal signing area
        │  (chest level)   │
        │                 │
        ├─────────────────┤
        │   Too Low       │  ← Avoid
        └─────────────────┘
              ↑
         Your body

Reference Points:
  [Person A] ←→ [You] ←→ [Person B]
     (left)      (center)    (right)
```

- **Neutral space:** In front of your chest (ideal signing area)
- **Personal space:** Near your body
- **Reference points:** Locations you establish for people/things

**Important:** Keep your signing in a comfortable space in front of you, not too high or too low.

#### 5. Non-Manual Markers (NMMs)
Facial expressions and body movements are grammatical in ASL:

```
Facial Expression Guide:

Yes/No Questions:          WH-Questions:
    ╭─────╮                     ╭─────╮
    │  ╱╲  │  ← Eyebrows UP      │  ╲╱  │  ← Eyebrows DOWN
    │ ( o ) │                     │ ( o ) │
    │  ╰─╯  │                     │  ╰─╯  │
    └───────┘                     └───────┘

Emphasis (Wide Eyes):       Intensity (Squinted):
    ╭─────╮                     ╭─────╮
    │ ╱ ╲ │                     │ ╲ ╱ │
    │( O )│  ← Eyes WIDE        │( - )│  ← Eyes SQUINTED
    │ ╰─╯ │                     │ ╰─╯ │
    └─────┘                     └─────┘

Head Movements:
  Nod ↑↓  = Yes, agreement
  Shake ↔ = No, negation
  Tilt ↖↗ = Question, curiosity
```

- **Eyebrows:** Up for yes/no questions, down for WH-questions
- **Eyes:** Wide for emphasis, squinted for intensity
- **Mouth:** Shapes and movements add meaning
- **Head:** Nodding, shaking, tilting convey information
- **Body:** Leaning, shifting weight show perspective

**Example:** The sign "GOOD" with a big smile means "great!" The same sign with a frown means "just okay."

#### 6. Hand Dominance
- Choose your dominant hand (usually your writing hand)
- Use your dominant hand for one-handed signs
- Use both hands symmetrically for two-handed signs
- Keep your non-dominant hand steady when needed

#### 7. Fingerspelling Basics
Fingerspelling is used for:
- Names of people and places
- Words without established signs
- Technical terms
- Emphasis

**Rules:**
- Keep hand steady, don't bounce
- Form each letter clearly
- Maintain consistent pace
- Don't mouth each letter (mouth the word)
- Use appropriate speed (not too fast or slow)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Bouncing your hand
- Forming letters unclearly
- Going too fast
- Not maintaining space

#### 8. Introduction to Deaf Culture
- **Deaf vs. deaf:** "Deaf" (capital D) refers to cultural identity; "deaf" refers to audiological condition
- **Deaf community:** A linguistic and cultural minority
- **ASL as identity:** Language is central to Deaf identity
- **Respect:** Learn about the community you're entering

### Exercises (Complete all 5)

4. **Space Awareness:** Practice signing in front of a mirror, keeping signs in neutral space
5. **Non-Manual Markers:** Practice facial expressions: happy, sad, surprised, questioning
