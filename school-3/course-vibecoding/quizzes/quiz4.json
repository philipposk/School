    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Why is context important in prompts?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Context helps AI understand your project structure, existing patterns, conventions, and requirements. This leads to code that fits your project better and follows your established patterns."

      "id": 8,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What are the benefits of breaking down complex features?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Benefits include: AI handles smaller tasks better, you can review and refine each step, easier to debug issues, and more control over the generation process."

    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What should you check when reviewing generated code?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Check: functionality (does it work?), code quality (follows conventions?), integration (works with existing code?), security (no sensitive data exposed?), and whether it meets requirements."

    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Explain the iterative refinement cycle.",
      "sampleAnswer": "Start with initial prompt, add details, add style requirements, add technical details, then refine based on output. Each iteration improves the prompt and resulting code."
