      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "List three things AI coding assistants do well.",
      "sampleAnswer": "AI coding assistants excel at: 1) Generating boilerplate code, 2) Creating common patterns and following conventions, 3) Writing tests, 4) Refactoring code, 5) Following established coding styles."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Why is it important to review AI-generated code before using it?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Reviewing AI-generated code is important because: AI can make mistakes, might miss edge cases, may not understand complex business logic without context, and you need to ensure it follows your project's conventions and requirements."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What is the difference between Cursor Chat and Cursor Composer?",
      "sampleAnswer": "Cursor Chat is conversational and iterative, good for exploration and refinement. Cursor Composer is for multi-file generation, good for creating complete features across multiple files simultaneously."

    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "Explain one limitation of AI coding assistants.",
      "sampleAnswer": "AI coding assistants struggle with: understanding complex business logic without context, making architectural decisions without guidance, handling edge cases without explicit instructions, or optimizing performance without clear requirements."
