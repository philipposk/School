2. Create effective CURSOR_RULES.md files that guide AI behavior
3. Write comprehensive INSTRUCTIONS.md files for app requirements
4. Use AI to generate, test, and refine production-ready code
5. Implement iterative refinement strategies for incremental improvements
6. Integrate AI-generated code with external APIs and services
7. Deploy applications using modern platforms (Vercel, Netlify)
8. Debug and troubleshoot AI-generated code effectively
