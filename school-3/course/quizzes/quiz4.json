      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Base-rate neglect occurs when people ignore general probabilities in favor of specific information."

      "options": ["probability of A and B", "probability of A given B", "probability of B given A", "probability of A or B"],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "P(A|B) represents conditional probability - the probability of A occurring given that B has occurred."

      "explanation": "Posterior probability combines prior beliefs with new evidence using Bayesian reasoning."

        "they are memorable and seem more likely",
        "availability heuristic makes them stand out",
        "people ignore base rates",
        "vivid examples override statistics"
      ],
      "explanation": "Rare but memorable events feel more probable than they actually are due to the availability heuristic."
