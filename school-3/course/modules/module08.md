# Module 8: Decision-Making, Expected Value & Final Project

## Title: Applying Critical Thinking to Real-World Decisions

### Lecture Content

Critical thinking culminates in practical decision-making. This module integrates all previous concepts and prepares for the final project.

#### 1. Expected Value (EV) Framework

**Formula:** EV = Σ (Probability × Outcome Value)

**Applications:**
- Financial decisions
- Career choices
- Risk management
- Personal planning

**Benefits:**
- Quantifies trade-offs
- Reduces emotional bias
- Clarifies best options
- Handles uncertainty

#### 2. Framing Effects

**Impact:**
- Same information, different presentation → different decisions
- Loss aversion vs. gain framing
- Attribute framing

**Examples:**
- "90% survival" vs "10% mortality"
- "Save 200 people" vs "400 will die"

#### 3. Real-World Decision Contexts

**Personal Finance:**
- Investment choices
- Major purchases
- Insurance decisions

**Career Planning:**
- Job offers
- Education investments
- Career transitions

**Health Decisions:**
- Treatment options
- Preventive measures
- Lifestyle changes

**Technology Evaluation:**
- Adopting new tools
- Security decisions
- Privacy trade-offs

#### 4. Integrated Reasoning Approach

**Combine tools from all modules:**
- Logic for structure validation
- Induction for evidence assessment
- Probability for uncertainty handling
- Bias awareness for error prevention
- Fallacy detection for argument quality
- Clear communication for persuasion

#### 5. Ethical Considerations

**Decision ethics:**
- Impact on stakeholders
- Long-term consequences
- Value alignment
- Transparency

**Worked Example:**
Career choice EV calculation:
- Probability of job offer × (Salary × Satisfaction - Switching costs)
- Compare multiple options
- Consider non-monetary factors

### Exercises
1. Calculate EV for simple personal choice
2. Identify framing bias in advertisement
3. Define opportunity cost for decision
4. Create decision matrix for complex choice
5. Evaluate claim using 5 different module tools

### Final Project Assignment

**Choose real-world claim or decision from:**
- Public policy issue
- Technological development
- Scientific controversy
- Personal major decision
- Business strategy

**Deliverables (1500 words + presentation):**
1. Argument map of key positions
2. Evidence quality assessment
3. Probabilistic reasoning application
4. Bias analysis and mitigation
5. Clear recommendation with justification

**Presentation:**
- 10-minute video or live presentation
- Clear structure and visual aids
- Q&A preparation

### Grading Rubric
- Argument quality: 25%
- Evidence evaluation: 25%
- Probabilistic reasoning: 20%
- Clarity and persuasion: 20%
- Presentation: 10%
