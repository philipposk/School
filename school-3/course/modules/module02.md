# Module 2: Deduction - Propositional Logic & Syllogisms

## Title: Deductive Reasoning: Guaranteed Truth Through Structure

### Lecture Content

Deductive reasoning guarantees the truth of the conclusion if the premises are true. This module covers propositional logic and categorical syllogisms.

#### 1. Propositions
Statements that can be true or false.
- Example: "It is raining" (can be true or false)

#### 2. Logical Connectives
- AND (∧) - Both must be true
- OR (∨) - At least one must be true
- NOT (¬) - Negation
- IF–THEN (→) - Conditional

#### 3. Valid Forms
**Modus Ponens:**
- P1: If A then B
- P2: A
- C: B

**Modus Tollens:**
- P1: If A then B
- P2: Not B
- C: Not A

#### 4. Invalid Forms
**Affirming the Consequent:**
- P1: If A then B
- P2: B
- C: A (Invalid)

**Denying the Antecedent:**
- P1: If A then B
- P2: Not A
- C: Not B (Invalid)

#### 5. Categorical Syllogisms
**Example:**
- All mammals are warm-blooded.
- All whales are mammals.
- Therefore, all whales are warm-blooded.

#### 6. Testing Validity
Use truth tables or pattern recognition to test argument validity.

**Worked Example:**
- P1: If it rains, the match is canceled.
- P2: The match is canceled.
- C: It must have rained. (Invalid: affirming the consequent)

### Exercises
1. Identify connective: "You win if you score."
2. Which is Modus Tollens? Provide an example.
3. Give example of denying the antecedent.
4. Make a valid syllogism about animals.
5. Translate: "If the system overheats, it shuts down."

### Assignment
