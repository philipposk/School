# Module 4: Probabilistic Thinking & Bayes (Conceptual)

## Title: Thinking in Probabilities: Navigating Uncertainty

### Lecture Content

We deal with uncertainty constantly. Probabilistic reasoning prevents common errors and improves decision-making.

#### 1. Base Rates
People often ignore background frequencies (base rates) when evaluating specific cases.

**Example:**
Test accuracy 95%, disease rate 1%. Positive test ≠ 95% chance you're sick due to low base rate.

#### 2. Conditional Probability
P(A|B) ≠ P(B|A) - This distinction is crucial for accurate reasoning.

#### 3. Bayes' Theorem (Conceptual)
Posterior probability ∝ Prior probability × Likelihood

**Simple explanation:**
- Start with initial belief (prior)
- Update belief with new evidence (likelihood)
- Arrive at revised belief (posterior)

#### 4. Practical Applications
- Medical testing interpretation
- Reliability of predictions
- Evaluating claims with low priors
- Risk assessment
- Legal evidence evaluation

#### 5. Common Errors
- Base rate neglect
- Confusing P(A|B) with P(B|A)
- Overweighting recent evidence
- Underestimating uncertainty

**Worked Example:**
Medical test: 99% accurate, disease prevalence 0.1%
Positive test result: Actual probability of disease is only about 9%

### Exercises
1. Give example of base-rate neglect in everyday life
2. Why are prior probabilities necessary for accurate reasoning?
3. When does new evidence strongly shift beliefs?
4. Convert a real-world claim into prior+likelihood structure
5. Explain P(A|B) in simple terms

### Assignment

- Initial prior probability
- Evidence encountered
- Updated belief with reasoning
- Confidence level in conclusion
