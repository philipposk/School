**Informal Fallacies:**
- Errors in content or context

#### 2. Specific Fallacies

**Straw Man:**
- Misrepresenting opponent's position

**Slippery Slope:**
- Unwarranted chain of consequences
- Example: "If we allow same-sex marriage, next people will marry animals"

**Ad Hominem:**
- Attacking the person instead of argument
- Example: "You can't trust his opinion because he's not educated"

**Appeal to Authority:**
- Relying on authority outside their expertise
- Example: "Celebrity X says this diet works"

**Appeal to Emotion:**
- Manipulating emotions instead of reason
- Example: Using fear, pity, or anger to persuade

**False Dilemma:**
- Presenting only two options when more exist
- Example: "You're either with us or against us"

**Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc:**
- Assuming causation from correlation
- Example: "I wore my lucky socks and won, so the socks caused the win"

**Equivocation:**
- Using ambiguous language to mislead
- Example: Changing meaning of key terms
