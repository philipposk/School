# Module 4: Introduction to Investing

## Title: Risk, Return, Asset Classes, and Investment Accounts

### Lecture Content

Investing is how you make your money work for you. This module introduces investment fundamentals: risk vs return, asset classes, and investment account types.

#### 1. Why Invest?

**Inflation Erosion:**
- Money loses purchasing power over time
- €100 today ≠ €100 in 10 years
- Investing helps preserve and grow wealth

**Wealth Building:**
- Savings accounts: ~3-5% (barely beats inflation)
- Stock market: ~7-10% historical average
- Real estate: ~8-12% with leverage
- Compound growth accelerates over time

**Time is Your Advantage:**
- Start early = more time for compound growth
- €1,000 at 7% for 30 years = €7,612
- €1,000 at 7% for 40 years = €14,974

#### 2. Risk vs Return

**Risk-Return Relationship:**
- Higher risk = potential for higher returns
- Lower risk = lower potential returns
- No risk-free high returns exist

**Types of Risk:**
- Market risk (prices fluctuate)
- Inflation risk (purchasing power)
- Interest rate risk (bond prices)
- Credit risk (default)
- Liquidity risk (can't sell quickly)

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Conservative: Low risk, stable returns
- Moderate: Balanced risk/return
- Aggressive: High risk, high return potential

#### 3. Asset Classes Overview

**Stocks (Equities):**
- Ownership in companies
- Higher risk, higher return potential
- Long-term growth
- Dividends possible

**Bonds (Fixed Income):**
- Loans to companies/governments
- Lower risk, lower returns
- Regular interest payments
- More stable than stocks

**Real Estate:**
- Physical property ownership
- Rental income + appreciation
- Requires capital and management
- Can use leverage

**Cash/Cash Equivalents:**
- Savings accounts, money market
- Lowest risk, lowest return
- High liquidity
- Inflation protection minimal

**Alternative Investments:**
- Commodities (gold, oil)
- Cryptocurrency
- Collectibles
- Higher risk, specialized knowledge needed

#### 4. Investment Accounts

**Taxable Brokerage Account:**
- No contribution limits
- No withdrawal restrictions
- Capital gains taxes apply
- Flexible for any goal

**Traditional IRA:**
- Tax-deductible contributions
- Tax-deferred growth
- Required minimum distributions at 72

**Roth IRA:**

- Can withdraw contributions anytime

**401(k) / Employer Plans:**

#### 5. Time Horizon and Goals

**Short-Term (0-3 years):**
- Emergency fund
- Down payment
- Use: Savings accounts, CDs, bonds

**Mid-Term (3-10 years):**
- Car purchase
- Home improvement
- Use: Balanced portfolio (stocks + bonds)

**Long-Term (10+ years):**

**Rule of Thumb:**

- Bonds for stability
- Cash for short-term needs

#### 6. Getting Started

**Before Investing:**
- Emergency fund established (3-6 months)
- High-interest debt paid off
- Budget in place
- Clear investment goals

**First Steps:**
1. Open investment account
2. Start with low-cost index funds

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Waiting for "right time"
- Trying to time the market
- Investing without emergency fund
- High-fee investments
- Emotional decisions
