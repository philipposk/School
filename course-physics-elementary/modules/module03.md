# Module 3: Energy and Simple Machines

## Engaging Activities for Teaching Energy Transfer

### Overview

This module explores teaching energy concepts and simple machines to elementary students through practical, hands-on activities.

### Key Concepts

#### Energy Basics
- Energy as the ability to do work
- Different forms of energy (motion, heat, light, sound)
- Energy transfer and transformation
- Conservation of energy (simplified)

#### Simple Machines
- Levers
- Wheels and axles
- Pulleys
- Inclined planes
- Wedges
- Screws

### Teaching Activities

**Activity 1: Energy Transformation Chain**
Students create devices that show energy changing from one form to another.

**Activity 2: Simple Machine Scavenger Hunt**
Students find and identify simple machines in the classroom and school.

**Activity 3: Building Compound Machines**
Using simple machines to create more complex devices.

### Assessment
- Student presentations of their machines
- Drawings showing energy flow
- Simple experiments demonstrating energy transfer
