# Module 2: Forces and Motion: Making It Tangible

## Teaching Newton's Laws Through Play and Experiments

### Overview

This module focuses on teaching forces and motion to elementary students using hands-on activities that make abstract concepts tangible and engaging.

### Teaching Force and Motion Concepts

#### Understanding Forces
- Forces as pushes and pulls
- Balanced vs unbalanced forces
- Multiple forces acting on objects
- Contact forces vs non-contact forces

#### Newton's First Law (Inertia)
**Concept:** Objects at rest stay at rest; objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by a force.

**Activities:**
- Coin drop experiments
- Pulling tablecloths
- Ball and cup demonstrations

#### Newton's Second Law (F = ma)
**Simplified for Elementary:** The harder you push, the faster things go (for same mass). Heavier things need more push to move the same way.

**Activities:**
- Pushing objects of different masses
- Measuring force with spring scales
- Race car experiments

#### Newton's Third Law (Action-Reaction)
**Concept:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

**Activities:**
- Balloon rockets
- Recoil demonstrations
- Walking and pushing activities

### Activity Examples

**Activity 1: Investigating Friction**
Students explore how different surfaces affect motion by sliding objects down ramps with various materials.

**Activity 2: Force and Motion Races**
Students design experiments to see how applying different forces affects the motion of toy cars.

**Activity 3: Action-Reaction Rockets**
Using balloon rockets to demonstrate Newton's third law in an engaging way.

### Assessment Ideas
- Observations during activities
- Student drawings showing forces
- Simple explanations in their own words
