5. **Review:** Verify and reflect
   - Does answer make physical sense?
   - Are units correct?
   - Check limiting cases

### Integrating Calculus with Physics

#### Common Challenges

- Practice recognizing when integration is needed

**Challenge 3: Differential Equations**
- Many physics problems lead to differential equations
- Students need strategies for solving them

**Solution:**
- Start with simple, solvable cases
- Use physical reasoning to guess solutions
- Show systematic solution methods

### Teaching Strategies for Advanced Topics

### Addressing Student Needs

#### Supporting Struggling Students

**Strategies:**
1. **Diagnostic Assessment**
   - Identify specific weaknesses
   - Check calculus background
   - Assess conceptual understanding

2. **Scaffolded Support**

   - Use analogies when helpful
   - Emphasize physical meaning

#### Challenging Advanced Students

**Strategies:**
1. **Extension Problems**
   - Open-ended investigations
   - Research connections
   - Connections to current physics research

2. **Peer Teaching**
   - Have students explain concepts
   - Lead problem-solving sessions
   - Create teaching materials

3. **Independent Projects**
   - Literature reviews
   - Computational physics
   - Experimental investigations

### Effective Assessment Methods

#### Problem-Solving Assessments

**Structure:**
- Multi-step problems
- Emphasis on process, not just answer
- Partial credit for correct approach
- Explanation required

#### Conceptual Questions

**Purpose:** Ensure students understand physical meaning, not just mathematics

**Types:**
- Ranking tasks
- Explain your reasoning
- Compare and contrast
- Identify errors

#### Laboratory Assessments

**Components:**
- Experimental design
- Data collection and analysis
- Error analysis
- Written reports

#### Exam Preparation

**AP Physics Exam Focus:**

### Common Misconceptions and How to Address Them

#### Misconception 1: Equations Are Just Math
**Issue:** Students solve equations without understanding physical meaning
**Solution:** Always ask "What does this mean physically?"

#### Misconception 2: Force Causes Velocity
**Issue:** Confusion about force, velocity, and acceleration
**Solution:** Emphasize force causes acceleration, not velocity

#### Misconception 3: Energy Is Lost
**Issue:** Thinking energy disappears in friction
**Solution:** Emphasize energy transformation, not loss
