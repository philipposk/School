## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Railway Trial**: 
   - You have 30 days OR until $5 runs out
   - After that: Need to pay $5/month

2. **Render Free**:
   - Free forever
   - But sleeps after 15min inactivity
   - First request takes 30-60 seconds

3. **You Can Switch**:
   - Start with Render Free (test)
   - Switch to Railway later (production)
   - Same code works on both!

---

## 🚀 My Suggestion

**Start with Render Free** to test everything:
- ✅ No cost
- ✅ Test all features
- ✅ See if cold starts are OK

**Then decide**:
- If cold starts OK → Stay on Render Free
- If need better performance → Switch to Railway ($5/mo)

**Both work the same way!** Just different hosting.
