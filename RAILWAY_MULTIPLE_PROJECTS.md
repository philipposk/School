# 🚂 Railway: Multiple Projects on $5/month

## ✅ Quick Answer

**Railway $5/month = ALL your projects, not per project!**

- ✅ **$5/month** covers **multiple projects**
- ✅ Credits are **shared** across all projects
- ✅ As long as **total usage** stays under $5 → No extra charge!

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Railway Hobby Plan ($5/month):

**What you get:**
- $5 in credits per month
- **Unlimited projects** ✅
- Credits **shared** across all projects
- Pay only if total usage exceeds $5

**Example:**
- Project 1 (School Platform): ~$3/month
- Project 2 (Other App): ~$1.50/month
- Project 3 (Test App): ~$0.50/month
- **Total**: $5/month ✅ (fits perfectly!)

**If you exceed $5:**
- You pay $5 subscription + overage
- Example: $6 usage = $5 + $1 = $6 total

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: One Project
- **School Platform**: ~$3-4/month
- **Total**: $5/month (you have $1-2 buffer)

### Scenario 2: Two Projects
- **School Platform**: ~$3/month
- **Personal Blog**: ~$1.50/month
- **Total**: $4.50/month ✅ (fits in $5!)

### Scenario 3: Three Small Projects
- **School Platform**: ~$2/month
- **API Service**: ~$1.50/month
- **Test App**: ~$1/month
- **Total**: $4.50/month ✅ (fits in $5!)

### Scenario 4: Exceeds $5
- **School Platform**: ~$4/month
- **Big App**: ~$3/month
- **Total**: $7/month
- **You pay**: $5 + $2 = **$7/month**

3. **Multiple projects allowed** ✅
4. **Pay extra only if** total usage > $5
