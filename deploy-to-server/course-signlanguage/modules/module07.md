# Module 7: Deaf Culture & Community

## Title: Understanding Deaf Culture and Community

### Lecture Content

Learning ASL without understanding Deaf culture is like learning words without understanding the people who speak them. This module explores Deaf culture, history, community values, and how to be a respectful ally.

#### 1. Understanding Deaf Culture
**Deaf vs. deaf:**
- **Deaf (capital D):** Refers to cultural identity - people who identify with Deaf culture, use ASL, and are part of the Deaf community
- **deaf (lowercase d):** Refers to audiological condition - people with hearing loss who may or may not identify with Deaf culture

**Deaf Culture includes:**
- Shared language (ASL)
- Shared values and beliefs
- Shared experiences and history
- Art, literature, and traditions
- Community connections
- Identity and pride

**Key Concept:** Being Deaf is not a disability in Deaf culture - it's a cultural and linguistic identity.
