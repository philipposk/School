# Module 8: Advanced Communication

## Title: Storytelling, Fluency, and Real-World ASL

### Lecture Content

Congratulations! You've learned the foundations. Now let's put it all together for advanced communication, storytelling, and real-world fluency. This module focuses on complex structures, idioms, and practical application.

#### 1. Storytelling in ASL
**Elements of ASL Storytelling:**
- **Character development:** Establish characters in space
- **Setting:** Use space to show locations
- **Plot:** Sequence events clearly
- **Emotions:** Use facial expressions and body language
- **Pacing:** Vary speed for effect
- **Visual details:** Show, don't just tell

**Character Establishment:**
- Place characters in different locations in space
- Point to location to refer to character
- Use body shifting to show different perspectives
- Maintain consistent locations

**Example:**
- "ONE DAY, MAN WALK PARK. MAN SEE DOG. DOG LOOK SAD. MAN APPROACH DOG..."
- Establish MAN in one space, DOG in another
- Shift body to show each character's perspective

#### 2. Using Space for Storytelling
**Locations:**
- Establish locations in space
- Reference locations consistently
- Use space to show relationships
- Move between locations to show movement

**Time Lines:**
- Past: Behind you
- Present: In front of you
- Future: Further in front
- Use timeline to show sequence

**Perspective:**
- Shift body to show different viewpoints
- Use role-shifting (become the character)
- Show actions from character's perspective

#### 3. ASL Idioms and Expressions
**Common ASL Idioms:**

**TRAIN GONE:**
- Means: "Too late" or "missed opportunity"
- Sign: TRAIN + GONE

**FINISH TOUCH:**
- Means: "That's it" or "done"
- Sign: FINISH + TOUCH

**TRUE BIZ:**
- Means: "Really" or "seriously"
- Sign: TRUE + BIZ

**OH I SEE:**
- Means: Understanding or realization
- Sign: Index finger touches eye, moves forward

**LONG TIME NO SEE:**
- Means: "Haven't seen you in a while"
- Sign: LONG TIME + NOT + SEE

**WHAT'S UP:**
- Means: "What's happening?"
- Sign: WHAT + UP (or variations)

**DEAF SAME:**
- Means: "Deaf people understand each other"
- Sign: DEAF + SAME

**Note:** Idioms don't translate literally. Learn them as complete concepts.

#### 4. Complex Sentence Structures
**Conditional Sentences (IF-THEN):**
- IF: Index finger, moves forward
- THEN: Index finger, moves forward (or implied)
- Structure: IF [condition] THEN [result]

**Example:**
- "IF RAIN, THEN I STAY HOME"
- "IF YOU HUNGRY, THEN EAT"

**Cause and Effect:**
- BECAUSE: Index finger, touches forehead, moves forward
- Structure: [effect] BECAUSE [cause]

**Example:**
- "I HAPPY BECAUSE I SEE YOU"
- "SHE SAD BECAUSE MOVIE FINISH"

**Complex Time Structures:**
- Combine multiple time markers
- "BEFORE YESTERDAY" (day before yesterday)
- "AFTER TOMORROW" (day after tomorrow)
- "NEXT WEEK MONDAY" (Monday of next week)

#### 5. Classifiers in ASL
**What are Classifiers?**
- Handshapes that represent objects, people, or concepts
- Show size, shape, movement, location
- Essential for descriptive signing

**Common Classifiers:**
- **CL:1** (index finger): Person, thin objects
- **CL:3** (three fingers): Vehicle
- **CL:4** (four fingers): Lines, groups
- **CL:5** (open hand): Large objects, surfaces
- **CL:B** (flat hand): Flat objects, surfaces
- **CL:C** (C handshape): Cylindrical objects
- **CL:G** (G handshape): Small objects

**Using Classifiers:**
- Establish what classifier represents
- Use consistently
- Show movement, size, location
- Combine with facial expressions

**Example:**
- "CAR DRIVE FAST" - Use CL:3 to show car moving quickly
- "PERSON WALK SLOW" - Use CL:1 to show person walking slowly

#### 6. Role-Shifting
**What is Role-Shifting?**
- Taking on the role of a character
- Shifting body and perspective
- Showing dialogue or actions from character's view
- Essential for storytelling

**How to Role-Shift:**
- Shift body slightly
- Face direction of other character
- Use appropriate facial expressions
- Show character's actions from their perspective
- Return to neutral for narration

**Example:**
- "MAN ASK WOMAN 'YOU HUNGRY?' WOMAN RESPOND 'YES'"
- Shift body left for MAN, right for WOMAN
- Show each character's perspective

#### 7. Real-World Scenarios

- Ordering food
- Asking about menu items

#### 8. Error Correction Strategies
**If You Make a Mistake:**
- Stop and correct yourself

- Or: Shake head, then sign correctly
- Don't apologize excessively
- Keep going

**If You Don't Know a Sign:**
- Fingerspell the word
- Describe it

**If You Don't Understand:**
- "SORRY, NOT UNDERSTAND"
