            <h2>Our Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At School, we don't just deliver content - we design learning experiences based on decades of educational research. Our platform incorporates proven pedagogical methods that maximize retention, understanding, and practical application of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Every course is structured using a combination of evidence-based techniques that have been shown to significantly improve learning outcomes compared to traditional lecture-based approaches.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Core Pedagogical Methods</h2>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🔄 Spaced Repetition</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Information is reviewed at increasing intervals to strengthen memory retention.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Our platform automatically schedules review sessions for key concepts. As you progress, previously learned material is reintroduced at optimal intervals based on your performance. This ensures that knowledge moves from short-term to long-term memory.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Research shows that spaced repetition can improve long-term retention by up to 200% compared to massed practice (cramming).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🧠 Active Recall</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Actively retrieving information from memory rather than passively re-reading.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Our quizzes, flashcards, and practice exercises require you to actively recall information. Instead of just watching videos, you're constantly tested on what you've learned, forcing your brain to strengthen neural pathways.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Active recall creates stronger memory traces than passive review. Studies show it can improve retention by 50-70%.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🎯 Mastery-Based Learning</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Students must demonstrate mastery of a concept before moving to the next level.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> You can't progress to the next module until you've passed the current module's quiz (70% minimum). This ensures you have a solid foundation before building more complex knowledge.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Prevents knowledge gaps that compound over time. Students learn at their own pace without being left behind or bored.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🏗️ Project-Based Learning</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Learning through hands-on projects that apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Each course includes practical assignments and projects. For example, in our web development course, you'll build actual websites. In finance, you'll analyze real market data.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Projects create context and meaning, making knowledge more memorable and applicable. Students report 40% better retention with project-based learning.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>📊 Formative Assessment</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Continuous, low-stakes assessments that provide feedback during learning rather than only at the end.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Every module includes quizzes, practice exercises, and self-assessments. You get immediate feedback on your understanding, allowing you to identify and address gaps before they become problems.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Formative assessment helps students understand their learning progress and adjust their strategies. It's been shown to improve final exam performance by 15-25%.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🎨 Multimodal Learning</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Presenting information through multiple channels (visual, auditory, kinesthetic).</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Our courses combine text, videos, interactive exercises, diagrams, code examples, and hands-on projects. This caters to different learning styles and reinforces concepts through multiple pathways.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Different people learn differently. Multimodal presentation ensures that whether you're a visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learner, you'll find content that resonates with you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🤝 Social Learning</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Learning through interaction with peers, discussions, and collaborative activities.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Our forum system allows you to discuss concepts with other students, ask questions, and learn from different perspectives. You can also connect with friends and study together.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Explaining concepts to others (the "protégé effect") improves your own understanding. Peer discussion exposes you to different viewpoints and problem-solving approaches.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="method-card">
                <h3>🤖 AI-Powered Personalization</h3>
                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Adaptive learning paths that adjust to your individual needs and performance.</p>
                <p><strong>How we use it:</strong> Our AI tutor analyzes your progress, identifies areas where you struggle, and provides personalized recommendations. It can suggest additional resources, review sessions, or alternative explanations.</p>
                <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Personalized learning addresses individual needs, keeping students engaged and ensuring they don't get stuck on concepts they find difficult.</p>
